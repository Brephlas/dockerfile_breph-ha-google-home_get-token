# dockerfile_breph-ha-google-home_get-token

Source for https://hub.docker.com/r/breph/ha-google-home_get-token which was created to make the process of getting a master token from Google's Foyer API more easy. Especially used for the home assistant integration [ha-google-home](https://github.com/leikoilja/ha-google-home).

The script `get_tokens.py` is a slightly modified version from this one: https://gist.github.com/rithvikvibhu/952f83ea656c6782fbd0f1645059055d
